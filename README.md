# Handwriting digits to text

Used Pycharm to blend PyQt5 and Tensorflow to predict numbers being drawn on a paint application.
The hardest part about this application was learnnin how to use the tensorflow model.<br />

### what I learn

- Learned how to use tensorflow to create a convolutional neural network model
- It is very important to normalize the data before fitting the model
- there are different layer activations modes: sigmoid for binary results and softmax for multiple neurons
- Multiple other concepts such as linear regression or loss.

### How to run it

if you would like to run the code just install the corresponding packages 

<pre>
pip install PyQt5
</pre>
<pre>
pip install tensorflow
</pre>

Regarding to the tensorflow package, there is a lot more to configure depending on you device components.<br />
If you have a compatible GPU you should install:
<pre>
pip install tensorflow-gpu
</pre>

Along with the corresponding Nvidia CUDA version. In my case, I just used the standard Tanserflow package
If you would like to know more about Tensorflow just visit their main website https://www.tensorflow.org/.
